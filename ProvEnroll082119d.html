					<h2>Introduction</h2>

					<p>Durable Medical Equipment, Prosthetics, Orthotics, and Supplies (DMEPOS) suppliers must meet the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) DMEPOS Quality Standards established under the Medicare Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA).</p>

					<div class="textbox floatRight">
						<h3>Face-to-Face Requirement</h3>
						
						<p>A physician must document when the physician or a physician assistant, nurse practitioner, or clinical nurse specialist had a face-to-face encounter with a Medicare beneficiary in the 6 months prior to the written order for certain items of Durable Medical Equipment (DME). For more information on the face-to-face encounter requirement, refer to <a href="https://www.cms.gov/Outreach-and-Education/Medicare-Learning-Network-MLN/MLNMattersArticles/Downloads/MM8304.pdf" target="_blank">Detailed Written Orders and Face-to-Face Encounters</a>.</p>
					</div>

					<p>DMEPOS suppliers must comply with the <a href="https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Monitoring-Programs/Medicare-FFS-Compliance-Programs/Downloads/Final-DMEPOS-Quality-Standards-Eff-01-09-2018.pdf" target="_blank">DMEPOS Quality Standards</a> and become accredited to obtain or maintain Medicare billing privileges, unless exempted from the accreditation requirement. Understanding the DMEPOS Quality Standards and involving all staff in the process will help you meet the DMEPOS Quality Standards and obtain accreditation. This tool outlines the DMEPOS Quality Standards, gives specific standards for some DMEPOS items, and provides resources for more information.</p>
					
					
					<div class="pageBreak">&nbsp;</div>
					<p>The DMEPOS Quality Standards consist of two sections and three appendices:</p>

					<ul>
						<li><span class="bold" onClick="jumpTo('SECTION1')">Section I: Supplier Business Services Requirements</span> addresses administration, financial management, human resources management, consumer services, performance management, product safety, and information management</li>
						<li><span class="bold" onClick="jumpTo('SECTION2')">Section II: Supplier Product-Specific Service Requirements</span> addresses intake and assessment, delivery and set-up, training/instruction, and follow-up</li>
						<li><span class="bold">Appendices</span> describe the requirements for specific types of DMEPOS items and services:
							<ul>
								<li><span class="bold" onClick="jumpTo('APPENDIX1')">Appendix A:</span> Respiratory Equipment, Supplies, and Services</li>
								<li><span class="bold" onClick="jumpTo('APPENDIX2')">Appendix B:</span> Manual Wheelchairs, Power Mobility Devices (PMDs), and Complex Rehabilitative Wheelchairs and Assistive Technology</li>
								<li><span class="bold" onClick="jumpTo('APPENDIX3')">Appendix C:</span> Custom-Fabricated and Custom-Fitted Orthoses, Prosthetic Devices, External Breast Prostheses, Therapeutic Shoes and Inserts, and Their Accessories and Supplies; Custom-Made Somatic, Ocular, and Facial Prostheses</li>

					<div class="miniWrapper">
					
						<p>These terms describe the types of devices referred to in this appendix. For more information about the terms used in this appendix, refer to the <a href="https://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and-Guidance/Guidance/Manuals/Downloads/bp102c15.pdf" tabindex="-1" target="_blank">Medicare Benefit Policy Manual, Chapter 15</a> or <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=ad090d2224191d1590e923ee9b085bb5&mc=true&node=pt42.3.414&rgn=div5#se42.3.414_1402" tabindex="-1" target="_blank">42 CFR 414.402</a>.</p>

						<div class="definitions">
						
							<p><span class="bold">Custom-Fabricated</span> A custom-fabricated item is one that is individually made for a specific patient. No other patient would be able to use this item. A custom-fabricated item is a device that is fabricated based on clinically derived and rectified castings, tracings, measurements, and/or other images (such as X-rays) of the body part. Fabricating may involve calculations, templates, and components. This process requires using basic materials including, but not limited to, plastic, metal, leather, or cloth in the form of uncut or unshaped sheets, bars, or other basic forms, and involves substantial work such as vacuum forming, cutting, bending, molding, sewing, drilling, and finishing prior to a patient fitting.</p>

							<div class="pageBreak">&nbsp;</div>
							<p><span class="bold">Custom-Fitted</span> Custom-fitted orthotics are defined as devices that are prefabricated. They may or may not be supplied as a kit that requires some assembly. They all require fitting and adjustment (for example, the item must be trimmed, bent, molded [with or without heat], or otherwise modified by an individual with expertise in customizing the fit for use by a specific patient). A custom-fitted orthotic requires modification of the item to provide an individualized fit. Modifications must result in altering the item beyond simple adjustments made by bending, trimming, and/or molding of the item, installing add-on components, or assembling the item.</p>
							
							<p><span class="bold">Custom-Molded Shoes</span></p>
							<ul class="disc">
								<li>Are constructed over a positive model of the patient’s foot</li>
								<li>Are made from leather or other suitable material of equal quality</li>
								<li>Have removable inserts that can be altered or replaced as the patient’s condition warrants</li>
								<li>Have some form of shoe closure</li>
							</ul>
							
							<p><span class="bold">Depth Shoes</span></p>
							<ul class="disc">
								<li>Have a full length, heel-to-toe filler that, when removed, provides a minimum of 3/16 inch of additional depth used to accommodate custom-molded or customized inserts.</li>
								<li>Are made from leather or other suitable material of equal quality.</li>
								<li>Have some form of shoe closure.</li>
								<li>Are available in full and half sizes with a minimum of three widths so that the sole is graded to the size and width of the upper portions of the shoes according to the American standard last sizing schedule or its equivalent. (The American standard last sizing schedule is the numerical shoe sizing system used for shoes sold in the United States.)</li>
							</ul>
							
							<p><span class="bold">External Breast Prostheses</span> Prefabricated or custom-fabricated forms, bras, and sleeves.</p>
							
							<p><span class="bold">Facial Prostheses</span> Custom-fabricated prosthetic restoration of the face including auricular, nasal, mid-facial, orbital (including ocular), upper facial, hemifacial, partial facial, nasal septal, and other areas of the face disfigured by traumatic injury, disease, and/or ablative surgery, or congenital malformation.</p>
							
							<p><span class="bold">Inserts</span> </p>
							
							<ul class="disc">
								<li>Are total contact, multiple density, removable inlays.</li>
								<li>Are directly molded to the patient’s foot or a model of the patient’s foot or directly carved from a patient-specific, rectified model.</li>
								<li>Are made of a suitable material with regard to the patient’s condition.
								</li>
							</ul>
							
							<p><span class="bold">Minimal Self-Adjustment</span> Minimal self-adjustment is defined at <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=ad090d2224191d1590e923ee9b085bb5&mc=true&node=pt42.3.414&rgn=div5#se42.3.414_1402" tabindex="-1" target="_blank">42 CFR 414.402</a> as an adjustment the beneficiary, caretaker for the beneficiary, or supplier of the device can perform that does not require the services of a certified orthotist (that is, an individual who is certified by the American Board for Certification in Orthotics and Prosthetics, Inc., or by the Board for Orthotics/Prosthetist Certification) or an individual who has specialized training.</p>
							
							<div class="pageBreak">&nbsp;</div>
							<p><span class="bold">Molded-to-Patient-Model</span> Molded-to-Patient-Model is defined as:</p>
							<ul class="disc">
								<li>An impression (for example, by means of a foam box impression, a plaster or fiberglass cast) of the specific body part is made directly on the patient, and this impression is then used to make a positive model of the body part from which the final product is crafted.</li>
								<li>A digital image of the patient’s body part is made using Computer-Aided Design–Computer-Aided Manufacturing (CAD-CAM) systems software. This technology includes specialized probes, digitizers, and scanners that create a computerized positive model and then direct milling equipment to carve a positive model. The device is then individually fabricated and molded over the positive model of the patient.</li>
								<li>For inserts used with therapeutic shoes for diabetes, a digital image of the patient’s body part is made using CAD-CAM systems software. This technology includes specialized probes/digitizers and scanners that create a computerized positive model, and then direct milling equipment to carve a beneficiary-specific insert.</li>
							</ul>
							
							<p><span class="bold">Ocular Prostheses</span> Custom-fabricated ocular prostheses that replace the globe of the eye or cover the existing unsightly eye as a result of traumatic injury, disease, and/or ablative surgery, or congenital malformation. Custom-made eye prostheses include conformers, scleral shells, and ocular prostheses that fit within the natural socket tissue and eyelids, as well as the custom-made ocular prosthesis component that is integrated into an orbital, upper facial, or hemifacial prosthesis.</p>
							
							<p><span class="bold">Off-The-Shelf</span> Off-the-shelf (OTS) orthotics are defined as those prefabricated items requiring minimal self-adjustment for appropriate use and do not require expertise in trimming, bending, molding, assembling, or customizing to fit to the individual. Appendix C does not apply to OTS orthotics.</p>
							
							<p><span class="bold">Orthotic Devices</span> Rigid and semi-rigid devices used for the purpose of supporting a weak or deformed body member or restricting or eliminating motion in a diseased or injured part of the body.</p>
							
							<p><span class="bold">Positive Model of the Patient</span></p>
							<ul class="disc">
								<li>Molded-to-patient-model is a negative impression taken of the patient’s body member and a positive model rectification is constructed.</li>
								<li>CAD-CAM system, by use of digitizers, transmits surface contour data to software that the practitioner uses to rectify or modify the model on the computer screen. The data depicting the modified shape is electronically transmitted to a commercial milling machine that carves the rectified model.</li>
								<li>Direct formed model is one in which the patient serves as the positive model. The device is constructed over the model of the patient and is then fabricated to the patient. The completed custom fabrication is checked and all necessary adjustments are made.</li>
								<li>For inserts used with therapeutic shoes for diabetes, a CAD-CAM system, by use of digitizers, transmits surface contour data to software that the practitioner uses to rectify or modify the model on the computer screen. The data depicting the rectified model is electronically transmitted to a commercial milling machine that carves the patient-specific insert.</li>
							</ul>
							
							<p><span class="bold">Prosthetic Devices</span> Devices (other than dental) that replace all or part of an internal body organ (including contiguous tissue), or replace all or part of the function of a permanently inoperative or malfunctioning internal body organ. This does not require a determination that there is no possibility that the patient’s condition may improve sometime in the future. If the medical record, including the judgment of the attending physician, indicates that the condition is of long and indefinite duration, the test of permanence is considered met.</p>
							
							<div class="pageBreak">&nbsp;</div>
							<p><span class="bold">Somatic Prostheses</span> Custom-fabricated somatic prostheses replace areas of the human body not included under definitions of facial and ocular prosthetics, but require visual and functional integration. Somatic prosthetics typically include finger, thumb, partial hand, hand, and toe disfigured by traumatic injury, disease, and/or ablative surgery, or congenital malformation.</p>
							
							<p><span class="bold">Specialized Training</span> Individuals with specialized training necessary to provide custom fitting services for patients with a medical need for orthotics include: a physician, a treating practitioner (a physician assistant, nurse practitioner, or clinical nurse specialist), an occupational therapist, or physical therapist in compliance with all applicable Federal and State licensure and regulatory requirements.</p>
							
							<p><span class="bold">Therapeutic Shoes and Inserts</span> Includes depth or custom-molded shoes along with inserts for individuals with diabetes.</p>

						<h3>Supplier Standards and <span class="noWrap">Quality Standards</span></h3>
						
						<p>Suppliers must comply with the current supplier standards to obtain and/or maintain Medicare billing privileges through the National Supplier Clearinghouse (NSC). The supplier standards are published in <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=0770d602233166b653f5e73ccb509bb0&mc=true&node=pt42.3.424&rgn=div5#se42.3.424_157" target="_blank">42 CFR 424.57(c)</a>.</p>
						
						<p>The quality standards are guidelines used by the CMS-approved AOs that suppliers must comply with to become accredited.</p>
						
						<p>The NSC and the AOs are completely autonomous. Compliance with one entity does not guarantee compliance with the other.</p>
					</div>
					
					
					<p>To enroll or maintain Medicare billing privileges, all DMEPOS suppliers (except for exempted professionals and other specified persons) must comply with the Medicare Program’s supplier standards and quality standards to become accredited. CMS deemed AOs to accredit DMEPOS suppliers as meeting DMEPOS Quality Standards under Medicare Part B. The accreditation requirement applies to suppliers of:</p>
					
					<ul>
						<li>Durable medical equipment</li>
						<li>Medical supplies</li>
						<li>Home dialysis supplies and equipment</li>
						<li>Therapeutic shoes</li>
						<li>Parenteral/enteral nutrition</li>
						<li>Transfusion medicine and prosthetic devices</li>
						<li>Prosthetics and orthotics</li>
					</ul>
